IORI FUYUSAKA
She believes she's an ordinary high school girl, with dreams and crushes and a sweet tooth. However, she finds herself at the center of a massive conspiracy, called on to stop an apocalypse before the world is doomed. What she's not sure about is: can she really answer the call? 

EI SEKIGAHARA 
A stoic young man with amnesia, Ei finds himself next to a dead body without any memories of his past. Declared a boy ""from another dimension"", he's constantly pursued by armed gunmen in black suits, and often finds himself in intense life-or-death situations. Through investing the clues and people in 1985, he chases the truth beyond his lost memories... 

KEITARO MIURA 
A dutiful young soldier from 1945, fiercely dedicated to defending his country. He'd lay down his life if it meant saving even a single soul. Chosen as part of a secret military program to pilot a new weapon called a ""Sentinel"", Miura soon discovers that his true enemies lie beyond World War II... 

MEGUMI YAKUSHIJI

However, she finds herself drawn into a massive, apocalyptic conspiracy in which the dangers of her favorite shows becomes disturbingly real. 

NENJI OGATA
A high school punk with a heart of gold. He prefers to punch first and ask questions later, so when he gets involved in a convoluted conspiracy, most of the geek-talk goes over his head.

TAKATOSHI HIJIYAMA

TOMI KISARAGI
A flippant, shy teenager. She often hangs out with her gal pals after school, getting snacks and chatting like any other, but she seems to know more than she lets on. Determined to investigate the mysteries of her fate, she surreptitiously follows whatever lead she can, only to discover even greater peril awaiting her...

YUKI TAKAMIYA

Danmaku Unlimited 3,Switch,2018-03-13,84,8.1,"Inspired by classic Japanese shooting games, Danmaku Unlimited 3 is a lovingly crafted medley of the best aspects of Japanese bullet hell games, all in a polished, accessible package.

An old school shoot'em up? Why is it worth my time?
Bullet hell style mechanics is having a kind of renaissance with its inclusion in many hit indie games. However if players want to explore more into the world of Bullet Hell a lot of traditional titles can be hard to understand in its mechanics or just plain too difficult to get into as a newcomer.

Danmaku Unlimited 3 is designed to be intuitive and accessible to players unfamiliar with the genre, all the while without losing any of the intensity and flashiness that makes the genre so exciting to play.

Okay, so how does the game do that?
CORE A staple feature in Bullet Hells, only the very center of the player's craft, the core, is vulnerable to enemy fire.

GRAZING Get the core close to bullets to just barely ""graze"" it will power up the player's craft. Once fully charged it can unleash a powerful rampage that makes you feel like a total boss.

SPIRIT/GRAZE SYSTEM Shooting down enemies turns their shots into harmless ghost bullets that the player can safely touch while also powering up the plane.

All of this allows the game to be at a level of challenge that is manageable for a wide range of players without reducing the game into a bullet free turkey shoot.
I'm good at bullet hell shooters, won't I just breeze though the game then?
The game has two unique modes, GRAZE MODE features a differently tuned system (with conditions to trigger the ghost bullets) that offers a higher level of challenge comparable to the toughest traditional bullet hell titles.
Is there a story?
It is about a guardian, entrusted with Earth, rebelling against her overseers. Shakespeare it isn't, but you are here for the bullets and explosions right?
How is the music? A Shmup is nothing without good music!
Music is by BLANKFIELD from Japan, who does awesome remixes of Touhou and many other anime/game musics!
Anything else?

- The campaign features 5 stages each ending with an epic multi-stage boss fight.
- Up to 25 weapon combinations for players to unlock and experiment to find what works best for them.
- Unique rendering technique that procedurally animate sprites on the fly.
- TATE support for players that use vertical screens. Or if you like to play lying down on your sides, I'm not going to tell you how to live your life.

Okay I'm sold! (Or not, if so then thanks for making it down to here!)

TLDR List

- Authentically crafted Japanese style shoot'em up in High Definition
- Intuitively designed to be an accessible gateway to the world of Bullet Hell
- 5 handcrafted stages packed with dynamically rendered sprites
- Epic multi-phase boss battles with spellbinding bullet patterns

LIFE ON ERLIN'S EYE
An abandoned station on the edge of a system in crisis. Run down, chaotic, unruly, and alive—it was founded by idealists in the shadow of a corporate collapse. Now it is held together by anarchic alliances, ramshackle factions and a shared desire to be free from the gravity of corporate control.

ACCESS THEIR SECRETS
Hack into the station’s cloud to access decades of digital data, uncover new areas and unlock secrets. This is your unique power, and with it you can change your future. Corporate secrets, rogue AIs and troves of lost data await those willing to dive into the depths of the station’s networks.

You are the product of an abusive system, in a universe where humanity’s expansion is marked by exploitation and extraction. Escape the makers of your decaying body, and chart your own path in a richly imagined, deeply relevant sci-fi world which explores ideas of precarity, personhood and freedom."

Curse of the Moon 2 brings classic 2D action and a dark, 8-Bit aesthetic together with modern playability. The multi-scenario structure of the previous title returns with an epic new story supervised by IGA (Koji Igarashi) himself. 

Players take control of Zangetsu, a swordsman from the far east who bears a deep grudge against demonkind and the alchemists who summoned them. Zangetsu must battle his way to the demonic stronghold, but he doesn't have to do it alone! Zangetsu can ally himself with a brand new cast of characters he meets along the way and add them to the playable roster. Each new character adds a variety of gameplay options, abilities, and ways to complete the game's many stages. 

Game Flow
Battle through stages filled with fearsome enemies and dangerous traps, each with a massive boss waiting at the end. A chance encounter with a potential ally awaits you after defeating a boss. Will they serve as a trustworthy partner on your perilous journey?

Increase Combat Abilities
You can instantaneously switch between allies you have recruited at any time! Allies have their own life bars, so with each ally you recruit, you're survivability is greatly increased! 

Shortcuts that Only Allies Can Access
Allies have special, unique abilities which allow them to use shortcuts to skip parts of stages or access new areas! There are no special items obtainable by taking the long way around, so take every shortcut you can find! If your allies are out of commission, you'll have to take longer routes, where stronger enemies await! When your life gets low, be sure to switch then out so they'll be available when you need them.

Multiple Episodes
The story is told over the course of multiple episodes. Only the first episode is accessible at the beginning, but more episodes will unlock as you progress through the game. The events that unfold in each episode continue into the next one, so be sure to unlock all the episodes to see the true ending. 

Curse of the Moon 2 had two play styles, ""Veteran"" and ""Casual"". 

Veteran Style
Choose ""Veteran"" style to experiment a difficulty reminiscent of older games. An enemy's sttack knocks the player to their death...something very familiar to retro game fans. 

Casual Style
Even if you're a fan of challenging games, sometimes you just want to take it easy! Casual mode is perfect for times like that. On Casual Style, things are more forgiving. Attacks don't knock the player back and lives are unlimited, alongside other changes. 

Changing Style
Style can be changed when starting a game, loading a save file, or on the Game Over screen."

La-Mulana 2,Switch,2020-03-17,82,8.4,"La-Mulana 2 features sprawling ancient ruins, mind-boggling mysteries, untold numbers of items, and terrible enemies combining to form what is possibly the perfect Metroidvania-style ""archaeological ruin exploration action game"".

In La-Mulana 2, you take on the role of Lumisa Kosugi - daughter of the previous title's hero - as she explores the ancient ruins of La-Mulana, said to be the cradle of human civilization. Desperate to find the cause of the numerous recent appearances of monsters from the ruins, Lumisa heads to the ""other"" La-Mulana: the ruins known as Eg-Lana.

Explore the vast ruins comprising multiple field maps, solve mysteries and riddles using the stone tablets and messages you discover along the way, and take out huge monsters known as ""Guardians"" as you make your way to the deepest depths of the ruins.

You won't believe the awesome mystery of Eg-Lana awaiting you at the end of your journey...

ABOUT LA-MULANA 2:
La-Mulana was known as a ""Metroidvania""-style game (a 2D action platformer with an emphasis on non-linear exploration). That said, the real core of the game is in deciphering the riddles scattered throughout the game, and solving the puzzles that exist as part of the ruins.

A classic experience: As with its predecessor, La-Mulana 2 will not feature a tutorial or a long-winded sidekick. As a seasoned explorer, it's up to you to discover the secrets hidden within the ruins and find the truth on your own.

Explore at your own pace: By deciphering cryptic text on the monuments scattered throughout the ruins, you will gradually unravel the mystery of the ruins. Which parts of the sprawling underground you tackle, and in what order, is up to you. Sometimes you will need to use changes in backgrounds, mysterious sounds, the strength of enemies, or the sneakiness of traps to detect subtle changes in your surroundings.

A colossal adventure: We have designed a variety of zones, and have created a mystery deep enough to encompass a gigantic cave system. This is a very large-scale indie title. We predict newcomers to the series will probably be able to clear the game in 20 to 30 hours. Because of the non-linear nature of Eg-Lana, La-Mulana 2 will have plenty of replayability.

New horrors, new weapons: Plenty of ferocious and terrifying monsters and guardians stand in your way in the depths of this new underground network. Fortunately, you will also have an arsenal of tools and weapons at your disposal to help you on your journey.

Widescreen support: The first La-Mulana was a remake of a retro-style game that ran in a 4:3 aspect ratio, which made widescreen support impossible. For La-Mulana 2, the various maps and rooms are designed to be 16:9-compatible, making it perfect for widescreen TVs and monitors.

The question we've asked ourselves throughout development is: ""How can we make an old-school 2D game take advantage of advancements in present-day technology?""

GAME FEATURES:
* Become an adventurer and explore sprawling ancient ruins
* Gather hints to solve the various mysteries of the ruins
* Dive into the action as you fight off tough enemies seeking to impede your progress

GAME CHARACTERS:
* Lumisa Kosugi (21 years old; fourth-generation Japanese; the game's protagonist) 
Some say she is Lemeza's wife's daughter from a previous marriage, while others believe she's Professor Shawn's illegitimate child. Either way, she is a Kosugi; that much is clear. She travels to La-Mulana to make her archaeological debut after accepting Xelpud's request to search the ruins.

* Lemeza Kosugi (36 years old; the previous game's protagonist)
Tales of his exploits in the ruins of La-Mulana may be known worldwide, but he was also responsible for the ruins' destruction, and has gone into hiding as a result. His love of exploration has not faded, however, and he still finds time to go spelunking in secret.

* Shawn Kosugi (67 years old)
After revealing the ""Treasure of All Life"" he brought back from the ruins of La-Mulana, he returned to a hermetic life once more. Although he technically retired after finishing his research on the ""Cradle of All Civilization"", he finds himself slowly drawn back into the world of archaeology.

* Elder Xelpud (Age unknown)
Upon the collapse of the La-Mulana ruins, his life as a 7th Child came to an end. He's been spending his time running the ""La-Mulana Ruins Tourist Spot"" in hopes of finding purpose in life once again. As a result, he's become quite wealthy, and now lives a life of luxury full of beautiful women and fast cars.

* Mulbruk (3024 years old; looks/hopes to look about 24)
Since her release from the ruins, Mulbruk has been happily living aboveground, pretending to be a ""normal"" young woman. Using her amazing knowledge of history, she has become a treasure hunter. She's also become quite fashionable."

Story:
In a far future, Earth was devastated by mutants who took control after a worldwide catastrophic event known as ""the big pulse"", a global scale electromagnetic pulse that put an end to all electronic technology on the planet. Humans are now enslaved by mutants led by ""The Boss"" in a world ruled by ""the law of the jungle"".
However, not everything is lost two humans and a mutant rebel are willing to fight in order to stop this madness. Will they be strong enough? Well... that's up to you!

Main Characters:
Gal: A girl who escaped from traders of humans. She's an expert in her own kick-boxing-derived martial art. While her attacks don't have a long reach, her speed and agility have no equal and her technique and endurance are pretty good too. She is capable of avoiding almost every attack, an ability that comes in handy when facing multiple foes.

Ricardo: A minotaur human-rights activist and a powerful wrestler. He's not very fast and his technique isn't as good as his comrades', but he has a pretty long reach, and his power and endurance are amazing. He's capable of destroying any enemy in record time!

F. Norris: A runaway ninja whose past is a mystery. He's the one who mastered the ninjutsu style known as ""the forbidden technique"". While he might be pretty fragile compared to Gal or Ricardo, he has a great combination of reach, power and speed, plus an amazing technique that (when mastered) can take control of any situation.

But the situation only gets worse when LABO’s nuclear reactor melts down, sending the facility into lockdown–with members of Sirius and survivors still trapped inside. With lethal radiation leaking everywhere and not enough anti-radiation medication to last until lockdown lifts, the survivors make more and more grim discoveries. In their struggle for survival, in a deathtrap full of fire and radiation, they learn that doubt is their greatest enemy, and trust their greatest asset.

The story of Root Double features two different protagonists: Watase Kasasagi, a rescue squad captain who has lost his memories in the hours after the incident, and Natsuhiko Tenkawa, a student piecing together the clues in the six days before. The only key to survival lies in the player’s hands with the Senses Sympathy System (SSS).

The conflict rocked the world, leaving half a generation of men and women lying dead on the battlefield. Of the many players that had acted on the world stage, only two remained; the kingdom of Cirinthia and the ancient Republic of Tariq. In time, Dimitri Noraskov, a hero to the defeated Kingdom of Arkadya, rose from the ashes. He saw his king as a coward for surrendering, and a traitor for submitting to the Treaty of Evenheart.

So did his people.

They supported Noraskov when he overthrew the king. They supported him as he reclaimed the lands that had been stripped of them. And they supported him as he raised an army. Noraskov had theorized that the nations of the world were still too wearied by the Great War to enforce the terms of the Treaty. Thus far, his gambit has proven
successful.

The Arkadyan Empire shows no signs of curbing its aggression. It is feared by many that a reprise of the Great War, that at one time could have been prevented, is now all but inevitable. But there are those that believe it can yet be stopped...

Rise of the Third Power is a love letter to the glory days of the console style RPG, with modern conveniences such as auto-save, and a combination of the best elements of Japanese and western style gameplay and writing.

Alternating between moving, attacking, using your dash, skills and luring enemies into hazards is the key to success. You are the one that decides the pacing of Evertried. Learn to think ahead. Develop intricate strategies to outmaneuver your opponents and follow your path to ascension!

Test Your Strategic Might
Hitting or defeating enemies in succession increases your Focus Level, which determines the shards you receive and unlocks special powers called Modifiers. The Focus Level goes down when you are idle or just moving, so there is incentive to keep up the action. Luring enemies to traps and getting hit by hazards will also affect the gauge, adding to the strategy.

Outsmart Enemies with Dashes and Skills
Moving strategically and attacking is vital. Close the gap with a Dash -- a mechanic that allows you to move twice the distance and ignore collision, allowing you to transverse an obstacle or gain a better position. Don’t forget Skills and Modifiers-- abilities and passive effects that can be equipped to create your build. Skills improve and carry over into successive runs, whereas Modifiers become stronger based on your Focus Level.

Customize Your Ascent Toward Destiny
The Tower has 50 floors divided into 5 Areas. Each area is unique and introduces new types of enemies. The higher you get in The Tower, the more complex floors will become. Each area has a Shop Floor, where you can spend shards acquired in exchange for health recovery, Skills and Modifiers. Plan accordingly to increase your chance of getting to the top.

Overcome the Guardians, Overcome Your Weaknesses
Each area ends with a Floor Guardian, a boss battle to truly prove your strategic might. Upon losing all your health, the Warrior will dissipate and lose previously acquired powers, reappearing at the First Floor to start ascending again. However, mastery in Skills will carry over into following runs. Rise again Warrior, and face your destiny."

While the total pros can try Iron Mode, where there’s almost zero room for error. Easy-to grasp controls and a minimalist UI underpin the whole game so anyone can easily pick up and play at their own pace."

Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation,Switch,2019-09-27,71,7.1,"An epic RPG with staggering depth, Dragon Warrior III immerses you in a deep adventure that you won't soon forget. Known as Dragon Quest in Japan, the Dragon Warrior series has produced some of the most popular RPGs of all time, and for good reason. Enix caters to their fans with an obsessive attention to detail, creating a universe which is both whimsical and realistic at the same time.

You get to control a young hero (male or female) in the land of Aliahan who is called upon by the king to defeat the Demon Lord Baramos. Your quest will take you through more than 50 caves, dungeons and towns, each filled with monsters to defeat and puzzles to solve. You can stock your traveling party with three companions from nine character classes, each with unique strengths and weaknesses.

U.S. gamers got their first taste of Dragon Warrior III in 1992, when the game was released for the original Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was massive even for a home console system, and Enix has upped the ante even more with the Game Boy Color version. Revamped graphics make the game look better than ever, new twists to the storyline keep things fresh, and plenty of other changes help to give the adventure a rejuvenated feel.

One of the most intriguing changes is the addition of a personality system. You're asked a series of questions when the game begins, and you are assigned a unique personality depending on your responses. There are over two dozen possible personality traits, and the game changes depending on your character's personality and gender. If you don't like the way you've been labeled, you can always read a book or two to alter your personality.

Monster Medals are another new feature in the Game Boy Color version. Monster Medals are sometimes left behind after you defeat an enemy, and come in three varieties: Bronze, Silver and Gold. Using a Game Boy Game Link Cable, you can trade Monster Medals with your friends to try to complete your collection.

There are over 150 different monsters to strike down throughout the game, including some new monsters like SeaSlime. The bad guys look great, because they were all designed by Akira Toriyama, creator of Dragon Ball Z.

Dragon Warrior III is an RPG fan's dream come true -- and it's portable. All hail the Slimes, and have fun overthrowing Lord Baramos."

Vorg heard a rumor that the army of Satan was searching for treasures called Seirei stones which led him to think that the time for revenge has come. In addition, he also knows that one of the Seirei stones was entrusted secretly to King Silverna from Vorg's homeland, the Kingdom of Miltia.

Vorg, who was a holy knight in Miltia, was in the forest town of Neraphai working for a mission when the king of Satan, Ifter, invaded the Kingdom of Miltia with Dhatilos armies.

Upon hearing the news, Vorg immediately returned to Miltia, but the kingdom has been destroyed.

After 7 years, a dark shadow went into the royal room inside the Silverna castle. That dark shadow was Satan, Ifter.

Vorg heads to Silverna castle with his Helos. Satan owns the Sol Divide which is the pair of heilos.

Dragon Blaze
Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Moon, and Sun. These four magic stones and the gods of the moon and sun brought prosperity in Megalith. Because of that, the people lived a peaceful and prosperous life.

However, their peaceful life ended when Nebiros and his armies appeared.

A long time ago, during the war of the gods when the world was created, Nebiros was defeated by the gods of the sun and moon. He was locked up by the 4 magic stones but was freed by summoning a country which aims to achieve victory in the war using him.

Nebirus, as an act of revenge, controlled the mind of the god of the moon using his dark power. The god of the universe transformed people's form and spirit into hideous ones and made them as his armies. And the entire Megalith fell into the abyss of destruction and chaos.

Nebirus' army has started to move towards the god of the sun. The god of the sun, who was threatened by Nebirus' move, entrusted the weapons of the gods to 4 dragon knights and ordered them to overthrow Nebirus.

Adaptions and references have formed a widespread legacy stretching back to the very beginning of the 20th century, latching on to the key fear of the human psyche: that of the unknown. Now, Call of Cthulhu will bring the mythos to life like never before, on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.

In this world, nothing is as it seems. Sanity is an irregular bedfellow, all too often replaced by the whisperings in the dark. Strange creatures, weird science, and shadowy cults dominate the Cthulhu Mythos, intent on realizing their mad schemes to bring about the end of everything. Your mind will suffer -- balancing a razor-thin line between sanity and madness, your senses will be disrupted until you question the reality of everything around you. Trust no one. Creeping shadows hide lurking figures... and all the while, the Great Dreamer prepares for his awakening."

Tachyon Project,Switch,2018-01-25,67,5.7,"In Tachyon Project you take control of Ada, a software program that has taken conscience and that was designed to hack into the most secure servers on Earth. After some rather misterious events, Ada is thrown out of the test server where it was living and out into the Internet, but when she tries to go back there she finds she's unable to. She'll then start a journey to uncover the truth behind what happened to her creators, which she considers her parents. In the process she'll find out that things were a bit more complex than she initially thought.

Tachyon Project is a dual stick shooter where we've taken concepts from the classic shoot'em up genre and tried to adapt them to the dual stick shooter genre. In Tachyon Project the player will find the gameplay versatility and speed traditional to dual stick shooters but with the variability in weapons and enemies that you usually find in shoot'em ups. The variety of weapons, secondary weapons and perks allow for hundreds of combinations for your ship. That, along with the number of different enemy types provides a lot of gameplay variety that is something quite unique in the genre.

Tachyon Project also brings new ideas to the table, presenting a new stealth mode in some levels where you have to pick carefully when to shoot to avoid being discovered too early and keep yourself disguised.

The game provides an interesting story mode where you go unlocking new weapons, secondary weapons and perks as you progress and uncover the story behind Ada's creation. But you can also play on challenges that present you with unending hordes of enemies to try for the best score and compete in leaderboards. You can play these challenges either alone or with friends in up to 4 player local multiplayer co-operative games."

These next few shifts will be far from ordinary or safe...

Night Call is a non-linear, narrative-driven noire investigation game. You are no detective, but you do have a gift. Around you, people feel more at ease. They talk. They share their thoughts, their emotions, their stories... their secrets. To passengers, you are more than just a driver; you are also a friend, a confidant, a shrink. A voyeur catching a glimpse under the masked but very real lives throughout the City of Light. And you'll need to play these roles well if you want to catch the killer.

Use the limited time you have available each night to gather clues while earning money to pay your bills. Drive passengers to their destinations, hear their stories and choose your responses carefully -- some are just regular people with a tale to tell, while others might reveal a clue that's key to your investigation. Follow the right leads to uncover new info about the suspects, and don't forget to make enough money to buy gas and pay your bills.

It's a twin stick shooter for the modern age, an age where audiences are limited by time and want to be able to play when they want, how they want, and on whatever devices they want. Want to play on console whilst sitting on the sofa? Sure. Fancy a quick game on handheld whilst on the bus? Go ahead. Want the game to reward you whilst it's playing itself, on your mobile whilst at work? Don't let us stop you!

The introduction of an idle clicker metagame into an already brilliant and satisfying second-to-second experience adds a whole extra dimension to the genre. Not to mention it makes the game more addictive than crack once you get going.

Of course no Nosebleed Interactive game would be complete without the extra bells and whistles, so as well as an adaptive audio system (which you can remix to your heart's content) we've also got 13 minigames (including an FPS), Tamagotchi style virtual pets (or in our case, a Virtual Executives), and a massive suite of ship and weapon upgrades to unlock and mess about with."

The dogs start out relatively normal, but mutate and behave in surprising ways as the game progresses and their evolutionary lines advance.

Dogs have highly variable bodies controlled by a simulated genetics system. As they age, they periodically enter a pupal state and physically mutate. The foods they eat fill their guts with different flora, just like in the gif above. These flora influence the dogs' mutations, letting you craft and mold them to fit your own idea of canine (im)perfection!

Dogs need a place to call home, and it’s up to you to create an appealing habitat to help them thrive. As you play, you'll gain access to more and more objects and decorations. String together rooms and decorate them however you’d like. Give your dogs a relaxing place to sleep, set up an maze, or even cultivate a garden. There are no built-in goals, so you can prioritize whatever you like the most!

The dogs in this game are physically simulated, which adds a layer of uniqueness to almost every action they take. Two dogs with separate body structures will experience the world in different ways. They also have unique personality traits that influence the types of behaviors they tend to run and govern how they interact with other dogs and objects.

Wobbledogs is meant to be enjoyable simply to passively observe, but it’s also rewarding to interact with the dogs directly, whether that’s petting them to relieve some stress, tossing a pup around to watch it tumble through the pen, or helping your canine companion get free after it wriggled itself into a particularly tight space.

There’s just one problem: The DNA sample he’s collected isn’t a perfect specimen, which in turn yields some…less than perfect clones…

But fear not, Dr. Fetus knows how to solve this problem.
