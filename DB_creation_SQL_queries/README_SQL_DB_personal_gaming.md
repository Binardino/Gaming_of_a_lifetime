# List of all the games I played (and that I could think of)

## Limits to the method :
#- Positive preselection of games# 
high personal scores, most games having ratings greather than 75 : 
obviously all the games I played (or almost all of them), I chose them in the first place because I received positive feedbacks on them, or had very positive expectations, therefore almost all of them have very positive personal score - except few games I disliked after all, 
Therefore I really enjoyed most of the games I played (which is a good thing isn't it ?), which explains why the overal personal scores is very high 

#partial notation# 
for many games, this rating is made years (if not decades) after playing them, so my personal score relies on memories & feelings I now have when I remember playing those games back then
